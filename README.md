# Matthew_Young_Portfolio
This is a portfolio to document my projects that I create while I learn data science and machine learning. 
* Machine Learning Algorithms: Linear Regressions, Logistic Regressions
* Programming Languages: Python
* Libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, Cufflinks
* Software: Jupyter Notebook

## [Linear Regression Models](https://github.com/mbyoung99/Linear_Regressions)
* My continuous regression projects for sets of sample data using python with multiple libraries
* Includes single variable linear, single variable polynomial and multivarible regression models
* Analyses are performed with Python libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and SciKit-Learn

## [Logistic Regression Models](https://github.com/mbyoung99/Logistic_Regressions)
* My logistic regression projects for sets of sample data using python with multiple libraries
* Includes single variable logistic regression models and multivarible logistic regression models
* Analyses are performed with Python libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and SciKit
