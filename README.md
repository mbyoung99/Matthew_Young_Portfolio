# Matthew Young Portfolio
This is a portfolio to document my projects that I create while I learn machine learning algorithms. 
* Machine Learning Algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, K Means Clustering, Principal Component Analysis
* Programming Languages: Python
* Libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, Cufflinks
* Software: Jupyter Notebook

## [Linear Regression Models](https://github.com/mbyoung99/ML_General_Applications//tree/main/Linear_Regressions)
* My continuous regression projects for sets of sample data using python with multiple libraries
* Includes single variable linear, single variable polynomial and multivarible regression models
* Analyses are performed with libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and SciKit-Learn
